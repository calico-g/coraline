== Coraline

Coraline is an app to track and correlate basically whatever you want. 

It consists of an input page, where you can create and enter input for any number of items, and a charts page where you can see all the data points plotted against each other.

It is currently in development, and therefore lacking some crucial elements for prime time (like an ability to login, and test suites), but if you want to get into it, please do. I'd love any feedback you have.
